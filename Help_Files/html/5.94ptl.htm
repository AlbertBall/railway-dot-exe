<p><a name=5.9></a><b>5.9 Non-timetabled services</b></p>

<p>Non-timetabled services may be set up to use manual (i.e.signaller) control
only. Here all control is manual but a timetable is still needed to allow new
trains (or trams - signaller control is often more appropriate for trams) to be created and to set data such as powers and maximum
running speeds. These entries have start events of the form - <span
style='color:blue'>Snt;146-12 147-12;S</span> - where the final 'S' indicates
that it is started under signaller control. For these services it is useful to
use the description to indicate the route, so that this shows in the floating
window during operation and so helps in applying correct control.</p>

<p>Trains or trams operated under signaller control need skill to stop at
required positions because there is no automatic location stopping as there is
under timetable control. A train (tram) being stopped by a signaller command
brakes at up to three quarters of its maximum braking effort (this may be
considerably less if there is a long element in front), and it takes effect
when it reaches the end of the next full element. It will always stop at a full
element, so there is a need to be aware of element lengths, speed (the higher
the speed the more difficult the judgement), and position when the 'stop'
command is given. For regular stopping under signaller control - as may be
required for tram operation - it is suggested to experiment then mark the brake
application positions using text markers.</p>

will help to avoid errors.</p>
