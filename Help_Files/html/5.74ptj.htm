<p><a name=5.7></a><b>5.7 Repeating services</b></p>

<p>Most services may be followed by repeats, as in one of the examples
described earlier, consisting of '<span style='color:blue'>R;mins;digits;num</span>',
where 'R' is the 'repeat' marker, 'mins' is the number of minutes increase
between repeats, 'digits' is the last two headcode digit increase between
repeats ((this may be zero if all headcodes are to be the same, and if not zero
then the numbers roll over at 00), and 'num' is the number of repeats. A repeat
service that has a value other than zero for 'digits' must have digits as the last
two characters of the headcode. Note that shuttle feeder and finishing services
('F-nshs' and 'Sns-fsh') can't have any repeats, and shuttle services
('Snt-sh', 'Sns-sh', 'Frh-sh' and 'Fns-sh') must have at least 1 repeat.</p>
<p> When a repeating service has been created, it can be expanded (using the 'Expand repeats' button - enabled when a repeating service is selected) into separate equivalent services. For example a service that repeats every 30 minutes with 2 digits increase per repeat and 8 repeats in all can be expanded into 9 separate services at 30 minute intervals, consisting of the original service and 8 repeats. In addition every service that links to the repeat - splits, joins and new services - will also expand similarly. This can be very useful when developing timetables that have similar services but with different stopping patterns, uneven headcodes or timings. This is usually the case with real timetables. A repeat service is created first, then expanded, and each separate service edited to correspond with the real timetable. This is normally a much faster process than repeated copying and pasting, especially if there are several linked services.</p>
