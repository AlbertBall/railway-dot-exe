Session file compatibility:

Principle is that a new program should load an old session file (SF), and an old program should load a new SF (where the new SF doesn't use variables not recognised in earlier program).

Forward compatibility - old prog loading new SF:  Must be nothing in new SF that changes any existing variable or its behaviour.  Can have new variables providing old prog ignores them in a new SF.

Reverse compatibility - new prog loading old SF:  New prog must work without any of the new features being loaded from an old SF.  New prog to stop loading when old SF finishes without needing any of the new variables.  All new variables to be initialised to a safe state after SF loaded (unless already initialised) but can change during further operation.

Overall:  
New prog must not change any existing variables or their behaviour.
New prog can have new variables but must not be essential on loading an old SF.
New prog to initialise all new variables to a safe state after loading old session file, though they can change during operation.
New prog to stop loading when old SF finishes.
Old prog to ignore any new additions to the new SF.
Ensure that the last character saved for a record change can't be 'E' as that used to identify the end of the additions.
After additions finished add 'DummyStr = Utilities->LoadFileString(SessionFile); // "End of file at vx.x.x"  discarded', or "nd of file at vx.x.x" if the 'E' has already been loaded

new code is:

//additions at vx.x.x + brief description of additions
SessionFile.get(TempChar);  //TempChar has been declared earlier
while(!SessionFile.eof() && ((TempChar == '\n') || (TempChar == '\0'))) 
/*get rid of all end of lines & emerge with eof or 1st char of new section, but if that can legitimately be 'E' it can be confused with 'End of file at vx.x.x' in which case that must be tested explicitly, and if the line is 'End of file at vx.x.x' then goto NEXTADDITION, NEXTADDITION1, NEXTADDITION2 etc. (see v2.16.1 additions where this happens) */

{
    sessionFile.get(TempChar);
}
if(SessionFile.eof()) // old session file, NB ONLY goto FINISHEDLOADING when eof is true, otherwise use NEXTADDITION
{
//initialise variables for new prog, may not be needed e.g.
    TrainController->AvHoursIntValue = 0;  initialise variables for new prog, may not be needed
    TrainController->MTBFHours = 0;

    SessionFile.close(); // no TrainController->AvHoursIntValue & no failed trains
    goto FINISHEDLOADING; //don't like goto's normally but necessary here to avoid multiple else's
}
//TempChar now contains the first char of the next section, so get the rest & deal with the new section
//unless it's already been loaded the last line for this addition is:
DummyStr = Utilities->LoadFileString(SessionFile); // "(E)nd of file at vx.x.x" discarded ('E' may have been loaded earlier)
