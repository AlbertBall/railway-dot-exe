<p><a name=3.1></a><b>3.1 Adding and deleting track and user-defined graphics</b></p>

<p>Click <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_ADDTRACK.gif"> to add
elements, and the railway element panel will appear, containing a wide range of
elements, each on its own button, for building a railway.</p>

<p>Selection is by clicking the chosen element, then left clicking the railway
area below to place it. It is often helpful to display the screen grid during
building to indicate element locations. As many of the same element as required
may be placed by repeatedly left clicking the mouse in the railway area, and
other elements may be selected and placed similarly. To remove an element just
right click it. </p>

<p>To navigate off the visible screen the easiest method is to hold down the right mouse button on a blank area of screen and drag the railway with the mouse to a new 
position.  Other methods are to click the relevant 'move viewpoint' buttons 
<img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_BLACKARROWRIGHT.gif"><img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_BLACKARROWLEFT.gif"><img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_BLACKARROWUP.gif"> and <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_BLACKARROWDOWN.gif">, or press the arrow keys on the
keyboard. Holding down the Control (Ctrl)
key when navigating moves the viewpoint by a small amount, and holding down the
Shift key moves it by a large amount. Think of the railway area as infinitely
large, with a window 60 elements wide by 36 elements high visible at any time
(60 x 36 elements is for a screen resolution of 1024 x 768, other resolutions
contain different numbers of elements). The 'Home' button (or ‘Home’ key on the keyboard)
brings the display back to the original screen, or 'New home' sets a new 'home'
position. The zoom-out button <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_ZOOMOUT.gif"> (or 'End' key on the keyboard) displays the railway at a quarter scale,
and in this mode there are 'Home' and 'New home' buttons as before but these
operate independently of zoomed-in mode. When zoomed-out, the zoom button
changes to zoom-in <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_ZOOMIN.gif">,
which brings the view back as it was, as does pressing the 'End' key again. To display a particular area of a large
railway quickly, zoom-out, then click the area of screen required. This
displays the clicked and surrounding area in zoomed-in mode. In zoomed-out mode 
the railway can be dragged as described above or moved using the relevant buttons 
or keys.  All available keyboard shortcut keys are set out in <a href="html\700.htm">section 7</a>.</p>

<p>During build the <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_TRACKNOTLINKEDGRAPHIC.gif"> 'unlinked track' icon is
displayed on the left. All track must be properly linked before preferred
directions or track lengths and speeds can be set and the railway saved for
operation. Linking allows every element to store the positions and types of adjacent elements, and that information is interrogated and applied by trains and routes during operation.  Prior to linking, any element can be placed anywhere, but linking will only be successful for a viable railway. Track is linked using the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_VALIDATE.gif"> 'link track' button, but note that if
there are unconnected gaps these must be connected first. Any faults in the
layout are indicated by appropriate messages when the 'link track' button is
left clicked. When correctly linked the <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_TRACKLINKEDGRAPHIC.gif"> icon appears.</p>

<p>All track elements, when placed, are allocated an identification code,
referred to as the element ID, for example '15-27', based on the position of
the element on the screen. In this example the element would be at horizontal
position 15 working left to right (first horizontal position being 0) and
vertical position 27 working from top to bottom (first vertical position being
0). After the first element has been placed all subsequent elements are placed
relative to it. Elements that take negative values (i.e. above the top position
of the screen on which the first element was placed or to the left of the
leftmost position of the screen on which the first element was placed) are
preceded by 'N', so an ID of 'N12-N06' would represent an element 12 places to
the left of the first screen and 6 places above the top of the first screen.
Element IDs are used in timetables, performance logs and warnings etc.</p>

<p>User-defined graphics can be added to improve the appearance of the railway, incorporating any image file of type .bmp, .gif, .jpg or .png.  These files must be saved in the 'Graphics' folder in order to be used. You may wish to apply a graphic with a transparent background, and for this you will probably need to manipulate the file using an image editor of which there are many available, some free.  To add graphics click the <img width=30 height=30
src="../images/PictureImage.bmp">'select user graphic' button, and select from the files listed.  Left click the railway at the desired location for the graphic and it will be placed there, right click it and it will be removed.  Once placed a graphic can be moved, as described below in section 3.2.  Try to avoid placing a graphic directly over text, track or locations, as it will be obscured by these elements when the screen is updated.</p>
