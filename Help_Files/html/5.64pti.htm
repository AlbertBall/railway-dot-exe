<P>Finding track element identification numbers (IDs) for Snt and other events that require them is made easier by having the appropriate railway loaded, then temporarily 'hiding' the timetable by left clicking the 'Hide' button, and examining the track by enabling track information and hovering the mouse over the required element.  Note that the editor can't be hidden while an entry is being created, it must first be saved by clicking 'Save entry', but it can be saved in any state of completion.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="5.111w8h.htm">section 5.11</A> for some important aspects that will help to avoid errors.</P>
