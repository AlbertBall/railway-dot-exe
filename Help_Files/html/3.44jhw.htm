<p><a name=3.4></a><b>3.4 Saving and loading railway files</b></p>

<p>There are two types of railway file. Development files, used during building
and modifying a railway, have the extension '.dev'. Railways that are ready for
operation (operational railways) have the extension '.rly'. By default all
railway files are stored in the 'Railways' folder that resides in the same
folder that contains the program itself - 'railway.exe'.</p>

<p>During development, files may be saved (as .dev files) by clicking the <img
width=20 height=20 src="../images/RailSim2_SAVERAILWAY.gif"> button, new files
requiring a new name, but thereafter being saved under the same name unless
'Save railway as' is selected.</p>

<p>When all gaps (if there are any) have been connected, all track linked, and
all locations named, the file may be saved as a '.rly' file. This situation is
indicated by the corresponding three left screen icons all being green - <img
width=20 height=20 src="../images/RailSim2_TRACKLINKEDGRAPHIC.gif">,<img
width=20 height=20 src="../images/RailSim2_GAPSSETGRAPHIC.gif">, and <img
width=20 height=20 src="../images/RailSim2_LOCNAMESSETGRAPHIC.gif">. When saved
as an operational railway these icons are not displayed.</p>

<p>Operational railways may be modified, but if anything significant is changed
then the railway will revert to development status. If it is still operational,
it may be resaved under its old name, but this will have to be selected
manually, it isn't automatic. Beware though that existing timetables may need
corresponding alteration if they are not compatible with the changed railway.
If changes are made to preferred directions only (described later), then these
are not regarded as significant changes and the railway may be resaved
automatically under its old name by left clicking the <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_SAVERAILWAY.gif"> button. Such changes won't affect
timetable compatibility but may well affect the ability to set automatic signal
and preferred direction routes (explained later).</p>

<p>When a railway is saved the 'Home' position of the detailed (i.e. zoomed-in)
display will be saved, but not the 'Home' position of the zoomed out display
nor the actual position of the display at the time of saving. To change the
'Home' position select the display required then left click 'New home'. On
reloading the railway the first display will be at the 'Home' position.</p>
