note in timetabling: </span></h1>

<p><b>1. All train and service entries must contain a single start event which
must come immediately after the first line, i.e the line that contains the
headcode.</b></p>

<p><b>2. Except for signaller-controlled trains (see <A HREF="5.94ptl.htm">section 5.9</A>) all entries must
contain a single finish event, which must either come last, or, if the service
is to repeat (see <A HREF="5.74ptj.htm">section 5.7</A>), must be the one before last - the last being the
repeat.</b></p>

<p><b>3. Signaller-controlled trains (see <A HREF="5.94ptl.htm">section 5.9</A>) must contain either a start
event on its own, or a start and a repeat.</b></p>

<p><b>4. All location names used in the timetable must be where trains can
stop, even if they are only used for passing points. The drop-down box in the
timetable editor gives a list of valid locations if a railway with names is
loaded. Note that although continuations can be named trains cannot stop there.</b></p>

<p><b>5. Avoid illegal sequence events by ensuring that arrivals are followed
by departures from the same location, and moving train events (e.g. pass times,
departures &amp; 'Snt' events for moving trains) are not followed by events
that can only occur when stationary and vice versa. <u>Note that an 'Snt' event
is treated as moving (even if the starting speed is zero) unless (a) the start
location is the next timetabled departure point for that train and the starting
speed is zero; or (b) the train is a signaller-controlled train, its starting
point is a location, and its starting speed is zero.</u></b></p>

<p><b>6. Note that although a time-location (HH:MM;Location name) event can
represent an arrival or a departure (the program will determine which from the
context), it cannot be both. If both an arrival and a departure from the same
location is required without any events inbetween then use a time-time-location
event (HH:MM;HH:MM;Location). The times can be the same, in which case
departure will be 30 seconds after arrival, or different.</b></p>

<p><b>7. The only way for a service to link back to a service whose first train
is earlier than the linking service is by using a shuttle.</b></p>

<p><b>8. The program only works in metric units but conversion facilities are
included to change speeds in miles per hour to kilometres per hour, and
horsepower to kilowatts.</b></p>
