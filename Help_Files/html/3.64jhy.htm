<p><a name=3.6></a><b>3.6 Setting track element lengths and speed limits</b></p>

<p>These may be set by selecting an area as described earlier in 'Selecting,
cutting, copying and pasting etc.', or alternatively by selecting along a
length of track by left clicking the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_SETDISTS.gif"> 'check and set track element lengths and
speed limits' button. Before either method can be used the track must have been
successfully linked together - see <A HREF="3.14jht.htm">section 3.1 'Adding and deleting track and other
railway elements'</A>. After the above button has been clicked, left click the
track element that represents the start of the length to be set, then left
click another element in the direction required towards the final element of
the length to be set and on the desired route, and continue in this way until
the final element is reached. Sometimes, if there are two or more routes in
different directions from the start position to the next selected position, the
program may choose the wrong direction. In this case erase the selection as described below, then select the start position again, and select the element that is next to the start
position in the desired direction. This will set the direction correctly and
further points can be selected until the desired end point is reached. If there
is only one route between the start and end points then the second element may
be the end point. </p>

<p>To truncate part of a selected length just right click at the truncate
point. To erase a selection truncate to the start point, and to cancel a start
selection without making a second selection just click it again. Note also that if there is more than one route between the selected elements then the program may choose the wrong one.  In this case truncate back to the last correct selection and choose an element where there is only a single route available.</p>

<p>Note that the selection can't end on leading points, because the program
doesn't know which of the two legs to include. At each position the
box will indicate the cumulative length of the current selection, and the speed
limit. If the speed limits differ along the length then 'Mixed' will show in
the speed limit box. When the end point has been reached the required overall
length and speed limit may be entered in the boxes provided. If the length is
to be changed but not the speed limit then don't alter the speed limit value,
and vice versa. Other options include restoring the selection default values -
i.e. just reset to the default values (normally 100m and 200km/h - <i>but can be changed in Config.txt file - see below</i>) between and including
the start and end points selected; restoring ALL default values - i.e. reset
all track elements to their default values (a warning message is given if this
is selected); and cancel without making any changes.</p>

<p>Default values, normally 100m and 200km/h, are loaded into the program from the configuration file Config.txt.  These values can be changed if required by direct editing of this file using Notepad or any other text editor.  Instructions for editing are contained in the file itself.  If changes are made make sure that the file is saved as text only and retains the name Config.txt.  It can be reloaded without having to exit the program using the 'Mode' menu.</p>

<p>If just a single element is to have its length or speed limit set, then use
the selection method described in 'Selecting, cutting, copying and pasting
etc.'.</p>

<p>In this mode a colour code is used to indicate whether or not each element
is set to its default values: original colour = both defaults; red = default
length but non-default speed limit; green = default speed limit but non-default
length; and blue = both have non-default values.</p>

<p>Selecting menu items 'Information', 'Track information', 'Show' will display
individual element lengths and speed limits in the floating window when the
mouse is hovered over an element.</p>

<p>To check the distance between two points proceed as for setting lengths,
note the overall length in the 'Length' box, then click 'cancel'.</p>

<p>The program only works in metric units but conversion facilities are
included to change imperial lengths to metric, and speeds in miles per hour to
kilometres per hour.</p>
