<P>Navigation of a large railway is achieved by dragging with the mouse or by using buttons or keys to change the viewpoint as described in more detail in section 3.1.  A 'zoom' button allows the display to change between detailed and wide view, the wide view displaying at 1/4 scale so that the equivalent of 16 detailed screens may be displayed on a single wide view.  The viewpoint may be changed for each type of view so there is no limit to the size of railway that may be created.  Note that the wide view only displays track and locations, no location names or text is displayed.</P>
