<P>White, black or dark blue backgrounds may be selected when there is no railway present.  Track displays black on a white background or white on a dark background.  All other colours display the same on either type of background, so try not to select too dark a text colour for dark backgrounds or too light a text colour for a white background.  When black or white is selected as a text font colour the stored colour is always black, and it always displays white on a dark background and black on a white background.  This means that it is not possible to display black text on a dark background, or white text on a white background, which wouldn't be very useful in any case!  Any saved railway or session may be displayed on any background provided the background is selected before the railway or session is loaded.  When the program is opened it will use the same background that was in use when it was last closed.  This allows a preference to be selected and retained without having to keep changing it via the menu.</P>
