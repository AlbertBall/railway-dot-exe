<p><a name=5.7></a><b>5.7 Repeating services</b></p>

<p>Most services may be followed by repeats, as in one of the examples
described earlier, consisting of '<span style='color:blue'>R;mins;digits;num</span>',
where 'R' is the 'repeat' marker, 'mins' is the number of minutes increase
between repeats, 'digits' is the last two headcode digit increase between
repeats ((this may be zero if all headcodes are to be the same, and if not zero
then the numbers roll over at 00), and 'num' is the number of repeats. A repeat
service that has a value other than zero for 'digits' must have digits as the last
two characters of the headcode. Note that shuttle feeder and finishing services
('F-nshs' and 'Sns-fsh') can't have any repeats, and shuttle services
('Snt-sh', 'Sns-sh', 'Frh-sh' and 'Fns-sh') must have at least 1 repeat.</p>

<p>See <a href="5.111w8h.htm">section 5.11</a> for some important aspects that
will help to avoid errors. </p>
