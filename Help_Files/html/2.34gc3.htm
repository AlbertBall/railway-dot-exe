<P><B><A NAME="2.3"></A>2.3  Files:</B></P>

<P>There are two types of railway file.  Development files, used during building and modifying a railway, have the extension '.dev'.  Railways that are ready for operation have the extension '.rly'.</P>

<P>Timetable files (extension '.ttb') may be saved during development and when finished, and during operation the current state of the railway (a 'session' - extension '.ssn') may be saved at any time and reloaded at a later time.  </P>

<P>During operation a performance log of all activities is compiled.  This may be viewed on-screen or hidden, and is saved after operation along with a performance summary in a permanent text file (extension '.txt').</P>

<P>Railway image files (extension '.bmp' - bitmap files) may be saved at any time, consisting of track and text, with or without an element grid (useful for planning purposes during construction); with preferred directions; and during operation.  Image files always display with black track on a white background, regardless of the track colour and background in use.</P>

<P></P>

<P>It is suggested that unwanted performance logs, sessions and images be deleted periodically as they can take up a considerable amount of space.  This particularly applies to image files.  If particular images are to be saved then it is best to convert them to '.jpg' files rather '.bmp' files, using a suitable image processing program, since '.jpg' files take up much less room.  If particular sessions, performance logs or images are to be saved, then it is probably best to rename them to something more meaningful so that they are easy to distinguish from other similar files - but be sure to retain the same extension (i.e. '.ssn', '.bmp' etc).</P>

<P>All files apart from images - i.e. railways, timetables, performance logs and sessions, as well as an error log if a fatal error is encountered during program use, are all text files, and are readable using a word processor or text editor, though it is recommended that any file that is used by the program shouldn't be altered outside the program or it may not work correctly afterwards.</P>
