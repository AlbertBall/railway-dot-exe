<p class="MsoNormal"><b>6.10 Actions due</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During operation a list of trains with
required operator action times is available by clicking the </span><img id="Picture 2" src="../images/Show_Action_Due_Button.gif" alt="ShowOpActionPanel" width="16" height="16"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;'show actions due' button.&nbsp; It can be
removed by clicking the </span><img id="Picture 1" src="../images/Hide_Action_Due_Button.gif" alt="HideOpActionPanel" width="18" height="18"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;'hide'
button.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The list is updated approximately every two seconds and contains a maximum of twenty trains.  Headcodes are shown in ascending order of time to act in order to avoid delays, based normally on the time to reach a red signal. The time given should be regarded as a guide only, as it is estimated from available information which is likely to change.  Accuracy improves as the time shortens, so trains with short times to act are those that require early attention.  This feature is particularly helpful for railways that spread over several screens when many trains are out of sight.  Left clicking any listed headcode hovers the mouse over the train in question, with train information displayed provided that train information has not been deselected via the Information menu.  If the train is already visible on screen then the viewpoint isn't changed, but if it isn't then the viewpoint is changed so that the train is centred on the screen.  Make sure that the panel itself isn't located over the screen centre, or trains will be hidden by it.  The panel can be moved to any position on or outside the main screen by left clicking on the 'Actions Due' text at the top of the panel, holding down the mouse key and dragging it to where it is needed, and information about a train in the list is obtained by right clicking the listed headcode, again provided that train information is selected.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The time displayed represents timetable
time, not real time, so a time to act of say thirty minutes with a railway
operating at 16x speed represents a real time of less than two minutes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The list includes running trains, failed trains and trains due to enter at continuations.  Trains scheduled to start other than at a continuation are only taken into account when they appear.  No advance warning times are given for impending crashes, derailments or unexpected buffer stops, as in real operation, though when these things happen the time to act will be shown as 'NOW'. A '+' symbol next to a headcode means that the train is subject to a random delay (see section 6.13).</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Times are normally estimated based on the
time taken for a train to reach the next red signal, unless the train is on an
automatic signal route, when the time taken to reach the final red signal in
the route is estimated.&nbsp; A train stopped at an automatic signal doesn't require
operator action, though the train in front that is stopping it might well do,
and if so that one will be listed.&nbsp; Scheduled stops before the next red signal are
incorporated in the estimated time, with dwell times at each stop added.taking account of early or late running&nbsp;
Trains running under signaller control don't have scheduled
stops while under such control, so the estimated time excludes any timetabled
stops before the red signal.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Trains are excluded from the list if their
action time is 60 minutes or more, if there are trains in front before the next
red signal, or if their next scheduled event is anything other than an arrival,
departure or pass.&nbsp; These latter conditions can result in trains appearing in
the list with short action times, for example:-</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a train is standing at a red
signal after entering at a continuation and preventing another's entry, the waiting train will
appear as soon as the offending train has its signal cleared, which will leave
the new train with a very short time to reach the signal.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a train is due to finish and
start a new service at a location, the new service may be facing a red starter
signal and due to depart soon after it is created, giving a short action time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly for a train that changes direction at a location, the
action time will only appear after the change of direction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Note that it is sometimes good practice to hold a train at a red signal, especially if it is running early, if setting a route for it would cause another train to be delayed.&nbsp; In such cases the 'NOW' indication in the list should be ignored until the other train has cleared its route ahead of the held train.</span></p>
