<p class=MsoNormal><b>6.14     Setting reminders</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reminders can be set for future timetabled events to alert
the user to something that needs to be done when that event is reached. 
Examples are when a train is running late and it is intended to skip some stops
when the train reaches a certain location or to become a new service early; to
hold a train at a location longer than normal because another train is running
late but takes priority and will need to cross its path; a train is being
routed into a wrong platform and will require signaller control to reposition
it when it arrives; and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A reminder is similar in its effects to a warning (see
section 5.5).  Warnings are set during timetable editing whereas reminders are
set during operation.  Right click a train that is running under timetable control
then left click 'Set reminder'.  A list of future events for that train is
listed and when one is left clicked a confirmatory message is given in case the
wrong one has been selected, and when accepted the reminder is set.  Once set a
reminder can't be removed, if it isn't wanted then just ignore it.  When it
triggers it appears in the warning log at the top of the display area and is
accompanied by three short beeps if sound is turned on.  It is also listed in
the performance log.</p>
