<p><a name=6.6></a><b>6.6 Calling-on</b></p>

<p>A train that is held outside a station by a signal, which is red because
another train is preventing its entry on the track that the held train is
directed towards, may be called-on by the signaller into the platform. Under
these circumstances the train speed is severely restricted (30km/h max), and
the train will stop adjacent to the existing train providing it is not moving
towards the called-on train. Call-on availability is indicated by the <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_CALLINGON.gif"> 'call-on' button,
and also by the same symbol flashing on the left hand side of the screen. If
the signaller wishes to call-on the train then the 'call-on' button is left
clicked, then the signal that is holding the approaching train is left clicked.
The position lights then illuminate on the signal and unless a route or
part-route has already been set an unrestricted route is created into the
platform and the train proceeds into the station.</p>

<p>The following conditions have to be met before a call-on is available:- </p>

<p>a) the approaching train has stopped at a signal but not at a location; </p>

<p>b) if the blocking train is facing the approaching train it is stopped
awaiting a join or change of direction, has terminated, or is under signaller
control - otherwise it might depart and crash into the called-on train;</p>

<p>c) at least one platform element is free to accept the approaching train; </p>

<p>d) points (if any) are set for a direct route into the platform; </p>

<p>e) the approaching train is to stop at the station; </p>

<p>f) there are no more facing signals between the train and the platform;</p>

<p>g) the train in front is preventing the stop signal being released for the
approaching train;</p>

<p>h) the train in front is not exiting at a continuation;</p>

<p>i) the signal is within 4km of the platform; and</p>

<p>j) the route into the platform does not conflict with any other route. </p>

<p>If one or more of these conditions cannot be met and the train has to enter
the station then it will have to be taken under signaller control and allowed
to pass the red signal. Trains under signaller control will always stop for
trains in front, providing they are not moving towards the called-on train.
From v1.2.0 an unrestricted route may be set from the stop signal to the
platform and this will set all the points appropriately to allow a call-on.</p>

<p>After a train has been called-on and is stopped in the station, it can't depart
until the track is clear to the next signal in front.</p>
