<p><a name=6.7></a><b>6.7 Performance logs:</b></p>

<p>During operation a performance log is available by left clicking the <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_SHOWLOG.gif"> 'show performance log'
button. This may be hidden again by left clicking the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_HIDELOG.gif"> 'hide performance log' button. The log
may be dragged to any part of or to the side of the screen by left clicking and
holding down the button while the log is moved. This log shows all significant
events such as arrivals, departures, changes of direction etc. For timed
events, providing the time is within a minute of the scheduled time, before or
after, it is classed as 'on time'. Note that at least 30 seconds must elapse
between any two consecutive train events. Therefore if the scheduled departure
time is the same as the arrival time, departure will occur either on time
(providing the train arrived at least 30 seconds early), or 30 seconds after
the arrival time. When the train is within 10 seconds of departure the
background will change to pink to indicate that the train is ready to depart,
and on departure it will start to accelerate away with a grey background. The
log is saved to a text file along with a performance summary, score and rating
when operation stops. This is available for viewing in folder 'Performance
logs'.</p>
