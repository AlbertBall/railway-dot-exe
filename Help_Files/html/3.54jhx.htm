<p><a name=3.5></a><b>3.5 Selecting, cutting, copying and pasting etc.</b></p>

<p>During build, in 'Build/modify' mode, complete areas of the display may be
manipulated using the 'Edit' and 'Select' menus, and defining the area by
clicking then dragging the left mouse button. The area is defined when the
button is released. If a different area is required then just begin again by
left clicking the mouse button. When defined, go back to the 'Edit' menu, and a
range of options is presented for cutting, copying, deleting, rotating etc.
When cutting or copying are selected, left click the mouse anywhere inside the
area, then drag it to the new position. It will stay where it is when the
button is released, but it may be picked up and moved again if desired. If it
is to be moved to another screen then drag it to or beyond the edge, move the
viewpoint in the required direction, then pick it up and move it again. When
its position is as required go back to the 'Edit' menu and paste the area.
Pasting overwrites any track or text that lies in the pasted area. When a
selection has been moved then track element lengths or speed limits will revert
to their default values (100m and 200km/h), so they may need to be set again.
After a selection has been made there is an option to 'Reselect'. This
reselects the original area and is useful for example for repeated copying of
the same selection.</p>

<p>When text (as opposed to location names) is enclosed within a selection then
it will be moved or copied along with the track, but location names won't be moved
or copied because new locations (including moved or copied locations) are
always unnamed initially. Be aware also that to move or copy text the top left
hand corner of the first character of the text must be enclosed in the
selection (and this point will be slightly above the first visible character).
Hence even though the text may appear to move with the selection it may well be
found that on pasting it has been left behind. If this happens then it may
easily be repositioned using the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_MOVETEXT.gif"> 'move text' button.</p>

<p>Note that if the selected area contains a lot of elements then there will be
a delay before the next action can be selected. Please avoid clicking the mouse
buttons or dragging the area during this time because although nothing appears
to happen the actions take place after the delay and may not be what is
expected. The information panel gives advice as appropriate. Also, if a
selection is 'cut', and another option selected before selecting paste, then
the cut section will be pasted back where it is (although the screen display
stays the same the elements will have been deleted from the internal database
and need to be replaced), but if gaps are enclosed then these become unset and
if named locations are enclosed then these become unnamed.</p>

<p>An option is also provided to set track element lengths and/or line speeds.
This is in addition to the ability to set these parameters along the track,
which is described later. The option to set an area as a whole is useful for
example at stations, where blanket speed limits often apply and track element
lengths may be made much shorter so that more track detail may be included
without extending distances. Note that when using this option each track
element length is set individually to the values chosen. When setting lengths
along the track, the complete length is chosen and is divided up between the
number of elements that are included. Before this option can be used the track
must have been successfully linked together - see section 'Adding and deleting
track and other railway elements'. Information about track lengths and line
speeds is available from the 'Information' menu by selecting 'Track
information'. Then, when the mouse hovers over a track element these values may
be seen, along with the track identifier (ID), which is used in timetabling.</p>
