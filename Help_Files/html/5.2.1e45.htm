<p>The linkage for these codes is quite complex and is explained below.</p>

<p>A shuttle service is a service that runs from A to B, then forms a new
service that runs back from B to A and forms a new service that links to the
first repeat of the original service. <b>Shuttles are the only way for a
service to link back to a service whose first train starts at an earlier time,
all other links are forward links to later services.</b> The pattern must
repeat at least once, and may repeat as many times as required. </p>

<p>In practice shuttle services may be a lot more flexible than this, for
example: the first service may run from A to B; then form a new service that
runs from B to C; then part of the train splits off to form a new service that
runs to D (the service that splits off repeats as many times as there are
shuttles but is not part of the shuttle in that it can't link back into the
shuttle sequence); the remaining train at C changes direction then continues on
to E, where it is joined by another service from F (the joining service from F
repeats as many times as there are shuttles but is not part of the shuttle).
The service from F, together with the train joined from E then returns to A,
where it links back to the first shuttle service. <u>The essential feature of a
shuttle service is that it represents a loop, with the same start and end
locations, and a final service that links back to the starting service.</u>
Intermediate events (splits, joins, direction changes etc) are possible, and
any number of 'Fns' service finishing events that link to corresponding 'Sns'
service starts, but the final finish must link back to the starting shuttle
using 'Frh-sh' or 'Fns-sh', thereby completing the loop. No other finish types
are allowed. In the above example the shuttle runs from A to B to C to E then
back to A. The split off part to D and the service that starts from F and joins
at E are not part of the shuttle loop.</p>

<p>There are two more points to remember, the first is that <u>a shuttle loop
cannot consist of a single service.</u> In other words a service that runs from
'A' to 'B', then continues on by returning to 'A', cannot be a shuttle. There
must be at least one change of service, i.e. the shuttle finishing service
reference must be different from the shuttle starting service reference. This
is not to say that the same headcode can't be used for these two services
because it can, so to all appearances the same service does in fact keep
looping for as many times as there are repeats (though the performance log will
still record the fact that a change of service has occurred, albeit with the
same headcode). However the service reference (prefix + headcode) must change
at some point within the loop. This represents a program restriction in that a
service is not permitted to link back to itself. The second point is that <u>a
shuttle must have at least one repeat.</u> This should be fairly self-evident
since a shuttle that doesn't repeat is just two linked services.</p>

<p>It is recognised that the coding of shuttles services may be difficult to
learn, but it is considered to be well worth the effort as sophisticated and
interactive services become available. Nevertheless it is possible to run very
respectable railways without any shuttles at all, if preferred. A series of
interleaving shuttle services is provided in a sample timetable. Study of these
will lead to a good understanding of how they work.</p>

<p>The simplest form of shuttle is one that starts as a new train at the
shuttle loop start (and end) location (hereafter referred to as the 'loop
location'), and at the end of all the repeats remains at that location. The
code that starts this type of shuttle is 'Snt-sh', meaning 'start a new train
that is a shuttle'. The corresponding finishing code is 'Frh-sh', meaning
'finish and remain here or form a repeating shuttle'. The lines that contain
these codes also contain the service references for the linked shuttle service.</p>

<p>When setting the times for shuttle links the time for the 'Frh-sh' event
must correspond to the time for the corresponding 'Snt-sh' event <u>+ 1 repeat
time.</u>, and the repeat time must be at least as much as the minimum time to complete the loop. For example, if the minimum time to complete a shuttle loop is 25 minutes, then the repeat time might be 30 minutes, with an additional dwell time at the station where the service changes to the new shuttle of 5 minutes. This then makes the overall loop time correspond to the repeat time which is what is required.</p>

<p>As well as the looping shuttle services themselves, two other associated services are available, known as 'shuttle feeder' and 'shuttle finishing' services.  A feeder service is a non-repeating service that ends at the loop location.  It is normally used as a train of  empty stock from a depot to the station at which the shuttle begins.  This service starts as a normal service but ends with code 'F-nshs', which means 'finish non-repeating shuttle feeder service'.  The shuttle service that it forms begins with code 'Sns-sh', meaning 'start a new shuttle service from a feeder service'.  A finishing service is a similar non-repeating service but starts when all the repeating shuttles have finished, and is typically an empty stock movement back to the depot.  The code for a shuttle that links to a finishing service (as well as back to other shuttles while they are still repeating) is 'Fns-sh', meaning 'finish and form a new finishing service or a repeating shuttle'.  The corresponding starting code for the finishing service is 'Sns-fsh', meaning 'start a new finishing service from a shuttle'.  The lines that contain the shuttle codes ('Sns-sh' and 'Fns-sh') also contain two linked service references, the first is the linked shuttle reference, and the second is the non-repeating feeder or finishing service reference.  The lines that contain the non-repeating service codes ('F-nshs' and 'Sns-fsh') have just one linked service reference, corresponding to the relevant shuttle.  Feeder and finishing services don't have to appear together, a particular shuttle may have a feeder service but no finishing service, a finishing service  but no feeder service, both, or neither.  Also a single service can be both a finishing service from one shuttle and a feeder service for another shuttle, which is useful when a shuttle service changes frequency or stopping locations.</p>

<p>When setting the times for shuttle links the time for the 'Fns-sh' event
must correspond to the time for the corresponding 'Sns-sh' event (or 'Snt-sh'
event if there is no feeder) <u>+ 1 repeat time.</u> This is exactly the same
as the situation for 'Frh-sh' described above.</p>

<p>When setting the time for a finishing service the 'Sns-fsh' event time must
correspond to the time for the corresponding 'Fns-sh' event <u>+ 'n' times the
repeat time,</u> where 'n' is the number of repeats. For example, if the
shuttle repeats at 30 minute intervals and there are 20 repeats, then if the
'Fns-sh' time is 07:45, the corresponding 'Sns-fsh' time should be 07:45 + (30
x 20) minutes, i.e. 17:45.</p>
