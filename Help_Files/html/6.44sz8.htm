<p><a name=6.4></a><b>6.4 Running trains:</b></p>

<p>When running, the front reporting number (headcode) character is red, to
show that it is the front - obvious when moving of course but not so when
stopped. In signaller-control mode (see later) the front is indicated by a blue
character, both to show that it is the front and that it is in
signaller-control mode.</p>

<p>It is normally useful to keep train status information turned on, by
selecting menu items 'Information', Train information' and 'Show status'.
Timetable information is also useful when the destination is not otherwise
obvious, turned on by selecting menu items 'Information', Train information'
and 'Show timetable'. With one or both of these turned on the information is
given in a floating window when the mouse hovers over a train.</p>

<p>Trains have different background colours to indicate the different train
states as follows:-</p>

<p>grey = moving (black or white in zoom-out mode depending on the background
colour);</p>

<p>pale green = stopped at a timetabled location;</p>

<p>pink = train ready to start from a timetabled location (changes 10 secs
before departure);</p>

<p>bright green = stopped by a signal;</p>

<p>red = crashed or derailed;</p>

<p>light cyan = stopped at buffers, no attention needed;</p>

<p>cyan = stopped at buffers unexpectedly;</p>

<p>light blue = stopped by a train in front;</p>

<p>magenta = call-on available;</p>

<p>yellow = signal-passed-at-danger (SPAD);</p>

<p>caramel = stopped under signaller control.</p>

<p>In zoom-out mode (accessed by left clicking the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_ZOOMOUT.gif"> button) any train that requires attention
(stopped by a signal, stopped unexpectedly at buffers, SPAD, crashed/derailed
or call-on), is shown flashing, with the colour appropriate to the condition.</p>

<p>Flashing icons are also provided on the left hand side of the screen if
signaller attention is needed somewhere on the railway. These are especially
useful for large railways when trains may need attention that are off-screen
and can't be seen. Selecting zoom-out will enable the train or trains (which
will be flashing) to be located quickly. The icons are as follows:- <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_SIGNALSTOPWARNING.gif"> shows that a
train is held at signals; <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_BUFFERWARNING.gif"> shows that a train has arrived
unexpectedly at buffers (i.e. it is under timetable control and still has
timetable events to complete); <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_CALLINGON.gif"> shows that a train may be offered a call-on;
<img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_SPADWARNING.gif"> shows that a
signal has been passed at danger, and <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_DERAILWARNING.gif"> and <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_CRASHWARNING.gif"> show that a derailment and a crash
have occurred respectively.</p>

<p>Sometimes events occur that require signaller attention but are not covered
by any of the above flashing symbols. Such events include trains prevented from
entering or being created by existing trains, locked routes, or on points set
to diverge; trains unable to split because the platform is too short or another
train is in the way; and trains waiting for another train to join or to be
joined by. Warnings are therefore given in red above the railway display area.
These warnings scroll up in two columns (ten visible warnings in all) as later
warnings are given, but they may be cancelled by right clicking on the warning.
Cancellation is appropriate when a warning has been acted upon or does not
require action. It will be seen that when the mouse hovers over any of the
warnings the clock stops. This is to prevent new warnings scrolling up just as
the right click cancel button is pressed, as then the wrong warning might be
cancelled. </p>

<p>These warnings are in addition to any that have been set in the timetable
(see 'Timetabled and automatic warnings'). Timetabled warnings are useful for
example to indicate when a route will need to be set in the near future, say
when a train is approaching a junction at the end of a route controlled by
automatic signals. </p>

<p>Try to ensure that trains approach a stop location by passing along all the
relevant named elements rather than by entering obliquely via points and
missing out some of the named elements. This is to avoid the train missing the
relevant stop point for that platform and thereby failing to stop. Stop points
are set assuming straight entry into platforms.</p>

<p>If there is a station that has a split platform (i.e. a section of track
with no adjacent platform lying between two track sections that have platforms
belonging to the same location) then trains will treat these as two separate
platforms, but a train that is required to stop will only stop at first
platform's stopping point.</p>
