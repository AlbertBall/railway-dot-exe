<P><B><A NAME="5.10"></A>5.10  Formatted timetables</B></P>

<P>When a timetable has been saved and validated (the appropriate railway .rly file has to be loaded in order to validate it), it may be exported.  Exported timetables help in operating the trains and are located in the 'Formatted timetables' folder.  They may be exported from within the timetable editor by left clicking the appropriate button, or, when loaded for operation, from menu items 'File' and 'Export timetable'.  Timetables are created in two forms (a) traditional timetable format in spreadsheet form ('.csv' - comma-separated- variable files), readable and reformattable by Microsoft Excel or any spreadsheet program, and (b) chronological order in plain text ('.txt' files), readable by any word processor or text editor.  The chronological timetable in particular should be useful in planning operations in a proper sequence, and should match the performance log quite closely if the railway is operated efficiently and without delays.  Note that these timetables are likely to be quite big if there are many repeating services, so be aware that a lot of paper will be required if they are printed as a whole files.</P>
