<P><B><A NAME="5.8"></A>5.8  Using the timetable editor:</B></P>

<P>The table on the left of the editor lists all entries, the program-readable part beginning with START and followed by service references or 'Comment' if the entry begins with '*'.  If this part ends with a blank line it is marked END.  Other entries are marked '-' or '+' for before or after the program-readable part, and contain the first few letters of the text.</P>

<P>The buttons provided are hopefully self explanatory, and each has an associated hint, seen by hovering the mouse over it when it's active. Cutting, copying and pasting of whole entries is done using the buttons, but sections of an entry may be cut, copied, pasted and deleted by highlighting the relevant section, then pressing 'CTRL X' to cut, 'CTRL C' to copy, 'CTRL V' to paste, or 'Delete' to delete.  'CTRL Z' may be used to undo any changes.  Pasting may be done into new or different entries than those cut or copied from.</P>

<P>Commas must not be used within services because commas are used internally by the program to separate the events in a service, and if extra ones are added then the events that they appear in will be split and will not be understandable to the program.  The commas that separate the events are not visible.  Similarly semicolons are used to separate the components of each event, and they must not be used for any other purpose within services.  Semicolons are of course visible so their presence is clearer.  Commas and semicolons may be used freely outside services, i.e. in text preceding the start time, in text following all services, and in comments between services.</P>

<P>When adding services it is often helpful to copy an earlier service, then modify it, for example by changing service references, and adding or subtracting minutes (this changes all time values within the entry by the same amount).  It is best not to use the HH:MM time format in any position other than as a legitimate service time, because if add or subtract minutes is used it changes every HH:MM time that it finds in the entry. </P>

<P>If a timetable is changed then it must be saved before it can be validated.  If a timetable is being developed from an earlier one and the original is to be retained, then the 'Save timetable as' option may be used to save it under a new name.</P>

<P>It is not necessary to load a timetable (via 'File' and 'Load timetable') in order to edit it, but it is necessary to have the railway ('.rly' file) loaded in order to validate it from within the editor.  All timetables are validated prior to loading for operational use but for new or changed timetables it is better to check validity with the editor open so that changes may be made if necessary.  In order to use the list of railway locations from the timetable editor drop-down box it is necessary to have a railway loaded, but this may be in the form of either a '.rly' file or a '.dev' file.  Note that loading a timetable for operational use and for editing are different activities, a timetable still has to be loaded in order to operate the railway after it has been edited and validated.  Note also that continuation names are for location identification when trains enter and exit the railway, they are not stopping locations.  For this reason continuation names must not be used in the timetable, the validation check will raise an error if they are.  Also for this reason the location name drop-down box in the timetable editor excludes continuation names.</P>
