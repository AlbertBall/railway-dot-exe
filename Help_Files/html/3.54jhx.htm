<p><a name=3.5></a><b>3.5 Selecting, cutting, copying and pasting etc.</b></p>

<p>During build, in 'Build/modify' mode, complete areas of the display may be
manipulated using the 'Edit' and 'Select' menus, and defining the area by
clicking then dragging the left mouse button. The area is defined when the
button is released. If a different area is required then just begin again by
left clicking the mouse button. When defined, go back to the 'Edit' menu, and a
range of options is presented for cutting, copying, deleting, rotating etc.
When cutting or copying are selected, left click the mouse anywhere inside the
area, then drag it to the new position. It will stay where it is when the
button is released, but it may be picked up and moved again if desired. If it
is to be moved to another screen then drag it to or beyond the edge, move the
viewpoint in the required direction, then pick it up and move it again. When
its position is as required go back to the 'Edit' menu and paste the area.
Pasting overwrites any track or text that lies in the pasted area. After a cut there are two paste options.  The first, just called 'Paste', pastes the selected area with default track speeds and lengths, no preferred directions (described later), and no location names. The second, called 'Paste with attributes', pastes the selection without changing any track speeds, lengths or location names.  This saves having to reset all these values for a finished railway and is useful for making final repositioning adjustments or for changing the layout of an existing railway when using a different screen resolution.  Note that any additional elements needed to link the repositioned cut area to the existing railway will require speeds and lengths setting where the defaults are unsuitable, any gaps within the selected area will be unset and require resetting, preferred directions need to be reset, and if there are train entry points in the cut area the element identifiers will need to be changed in the timetable (see later).</p>

<p>After a selection has been made there is an option to 'Reselect'. This
reselects the original area and is useful for example for repeated copying of
the same selection.</p>

<p>When text (as opposed to location names) is enclosed within a selection then it will be moved or copied along with the track.  Be aware though that to move or copy text the top left hand corner of the first character of the text must be enclosed in the selection (and this point will be slightly above the first visible character).  Hence even though the text may appear to move with the selection it may well be found that on pasting it has been left behind.  If this happens then it may easily be repositioned using the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_MOVETEXT.gif"> 'move text' button.</p>

<p>Note that if the selected area contains a lot of elements then there will be
a delay before the next action can be selected. Please avoid clicking the mouse
buttons or dragging the area during this time because although nothing appears
to happen the actions take place after the delay and may not be what is
expected. The information panel gives advice as appropriate.</p>

<p>An option is also provided to set track element lengths and/or line speeds.
This is in addition to the ability to set these parameters along the track,
which is described later. The option to set an area as a whole is useful for
example at stations, where blanket speed limits often apply and track element
lengths may be made much shorter so that more track detail may be included
without extending distances. Note that when using this option each track
element length is set individually to the values chosen. When setting lengths
along the track, the complete length is chosen and is divided up between the
number of elements that are included. Before this option can be used the track
must have been successfully linked together - see <A HREF="3.14jht.htm">section 3.1 
'Adding and deleting track and other railway elements'</A>. Information about track lengths and line
speeds is available from the 'Information' menu by selecting 'Track
information'. Then, when the mouse hovers over a track element these values may
be seen, along with the track identifier (ID), which is used in timetabling.</p>
