<P><B>2.1  Backgrounds & trackside signal locations</B></P>

<P>White, black or dark blue backgrounds may be selected when there is no railway present and no mode selected (<a href="2.64gc6.htm">see section 2.6</a>).  Track displays black on a white background or white on a dark background.  All other colours display the same on either type of background, so try not to select too dark a text colour for dark backgrounds or too light a text colour for a white background.  When black or white is selected as a text font colour the stored colour is always black, and it always displays white on a dark background and black on a white background.  This means that it is not possible to display black text on a dark background, or white text on a white background, which wouldn't be very useful in any case!  Any saved railway or session may be displayed on any background provided the background is selected before the railway or session is loaded.  When ROS is opened it will use the same background that was in use when it was last closed.  This allows a preference to be selected and retained without having to keep changing it via the menu.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Signals can be located on the left hand or right hand side of the track so as to reflect correct practice for the railway in question.  When no railway is present and no mode selected (<a href="2.64gc6.htm">see section 2.6</a>) a message states which side of the track signals will be on.  This can be changed by selecting 'Convert to right [or left] hand signals' in the 'Mode' menu.  This option is only available with no railway present and no mode selected.  Note that the side that signals will be on is configured within ROS rather than being a feature of a particular railway, so a railway built with signals on the left can be loaded as a railway or as a session with signals on the right if that option is selected, and vice versa.  Signal location only affects the appearance of a railway, operation is exactly the same whichever side the signals are on.  Just like background colour the signal location in use when ROS closes will be the same when it is next opened, thereby avoiding the need to change it each time.</P>
