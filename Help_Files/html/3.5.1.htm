<p class=MsoNormal><b>3.5.1    Pasting in an application after cutting or
copying from another railway.exe application</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a selected area has been cut or copied, it is loaded
into the Windows clipboard and can be pasted into a different railway.exe
application by opening it, clicking on 'Mode', then 'Build/Modify Railway',
then Edit', then 'Paste'.  A second railway.exe application can be opened in
one of several ways: double clicking on the railway.exe icon in Windows
Explorer; double clicking on the railway.exe icon if present on the desktop; or
single clicking on the railway.exe icon if present on the taskbar with the
shift key held down.  For this latter method to work there must be an existing program
icon either on the desktop or the taskbar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some things to be aware of when pasting via the
clipboard a segment of railway that was cut or copied from another
application:-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.  Pasting in a new application from the Windows clipboard
is similar to pasting in the same application in that a cut will include
location names whereas a copy won't.  However user graphics won't be pasted in
either case because the corresponding graphic files must be present in the
Graphics folder, and that can't be guaranteed for a different application which
may be in a different location to the original application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.  The selected area will be pasted in the top left hand
corner of the screen, and any existing elements already there will be deleted. 
Move the viewpoint to relocate the railway if necessary to avoid any deletions
then in the other application click 'Cancel', select the area again and cut or
copy again, and return to the receiving application to paste it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.  If a cut segment includes a location name that is
already present in an existing railway then the earlier name will be erased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4.  Ensure that the application that is to receive the
external segment doesn't have any selections of its own still valid or a paste
from another application will fail or produce unwanted effects.  If a selection
has already been made in the receiving application, perhaps to move an earlier
pasted segment, click 'Edit' then 'Cancel' to clear the selection before
selecting the area to be cut or copied in the other application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5.  When an area has been cut or copied from an application
for pasting in another application, wait until the clipboard has been fully
loaded before changing to the receiving application or the paste may not
succeed.  When the information panel message says &quot;Left click in selection
and drag&quot; then the clipboard has been fully loaded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.  It is recommended to click 'Edit' then 'Cancel' in the
original application after pasting in the new application in order to retain
the original railway.  However if a segment was cut then gaps may need to be
reset and the track re-linked because in this case cancelling pastes the
segment back in its original position so track linking is lost and gaps are
pasted as unset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7.  When pasting from one application into another make sure
that both applications have the same version number or changes that are made
between versions may interfere with the process and give unexpected results.</p>
