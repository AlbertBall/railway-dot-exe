<p><a name=3.2></a><b>3.2 Adding, deleting and moving text and graphics</b></p>

<p>Text may be added to the railway by left clicking the <img width=24
height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_ADDTEXT.gif"> 'add or change text' button.
When this is selected left click the position on screen where the text is to be
added, and a text box will appear. Replace the information text that is already
present with that required and press 'Enter'. The text will remain where placed
in the font that has been selected. To change the font left click the <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_FONTGRAPHIC.gif"> 'change font'
button and enter the font, style, colour and size that is required.</p>

<p>To delete text, right click the first character with 'add or change text' selected, and it will be erased. To change
existing text, left click the first character with 'add or change text'
selected and a text box will appear with the existing text in it ready for
modification, when changed press 'Enter'. </p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT: Do not change the names of named locations (see later) by this
method, otherwise the displayed name will be changed but the location name
within the program will not change and the result will cause confusion.</b></p>

<p>If the font of existing text is to be changed without changing anything else
then select 'add or change text' if not already selected, left click the first
character to bring up the edit box with the original text, then change the font
using the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_FONTGRAPHIC.gif"> button
with the edit box still present. Then press 'enter' without changing anything
else, and the text will be changed to the new font. Note that this is slightly
different to changing the fonts of named locations. For them the font may be
changed first, then the location selected with the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_NAMELOCS.gif"> button, 'enter' pressed, and the font
will change. The difference is because it is sometimes required to change
several location name fonts at the same time, and it would be tedious to keep
having to change it for each separately. This is not usually the case however
for separate pieces of text.</p>

<p>When placed, text and graphics may be moved by left clicking the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_MOVETEXT.gif"> 'move text or graphics' button. When that has been selected, left click and hold the mouse over the first character of the text or anywhere within the graphic and drag it to its new location. The <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_PIXELPRECISION1.gif"> 'change text or graphic grid alignment' button may be used to set the required precision. When the smallest bar shows green then the text or graphic will move at the finest precision - one pixel at a time. Each
time the button is clicked the bar showing green will move to the right,
successively for 2, 4, 8 and 16 pixel precision, then back to 1 pixel
precision. Lower precision values (higher numbers) are useful for aligning
separate pieces of text or graphics with each other.</p>

<p>Text (but not graphics) can be placed on stations and non-station named locations <a href="html\3.34jhv.htm">(see section 3.3)</a>, but try to avoid placing text or graphics too close to track, as they may be partly erased by
moving trains and not appear again until the screen is updated, which might be some time. Arial 7pt is clear and small enough to allow text to fit between two
tracks, only the bottom of the descenders are erased by trains but this doesn't
degrade the appearance too much.</p>

<p>If railways are to be shared with other users or used on other computers,
ensure that the fonts used for text and named locations are standard Microsoft
Windows types, or the Windows operating system will default to the nearest font
which might spoil the appearance. Also ensure that any graphic files used by the railway are shared also, because although railway files contain graphic names and positions, they do not incorporate the graphics themselves.</p>
