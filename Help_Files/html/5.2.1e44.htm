<p>Join codes are 'Fjo' ('finish, join other') for the service that finishes by
joining another service, and 'jbo' ('joined by other') for the service that has
the other service joined onto it.</p>

<p>The lines that contain these codes also contain the service references of
the corresponding linked services. The thing to beware of during operation is
that both trains must be received at the same platform - fairly obvious of
course but easy to overlook at a large station when the trains arrive at
different times. Failure to observe this will result in signaller control being
needed to position the trains correctly. Also necessary is that the receiving platform must be long enough to
accommodate the two trains. Try to receive joining trains at platforms where
there will be at least one platform element free for the second train, which
may be behind or in front of the first train depending on the arrival direction
of the second train.</p>

<p>When trains join, their masses, powers and brake forces are added, and the
maximum running speed becomes the smaller of the values for the two trains.
Warning messages are given when one or other train is waiting for the other.</p>

<p>For services that join it is best to avoid descriptions that include the
number of cars. The original service description doesn't change during operation
so such descriptions will become incorrect after a join.</p>

<p>Note that when repeat service trains join, each service must have the same
repeat number. Services with different repeat numbers will not join, even
though the headcodes correspond correctly. Service repeat numbers are provided
in the train status floating window.</p>

will help to avoid errors. </p>
