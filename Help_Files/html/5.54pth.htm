<p><a name=5.5></a><b>5.5 Timetabled and automatic warnings</b></p>

<p>Any service event (except 'Frh' and 'Fjo' - see later) may be preceded by
'W', e.g. <span style='color:blue'>W14:23;Moor Street</span>. This represents a
'warning', and when the service reaches this point a warning message is given
in red at the top of the display area accompanied by three short beeps if sound is turned on.. Warnings scroll up in two columns, ten in all, and may be erased by right clicking. The latest is in red and bold text, and earlier ones in blue and regular text. Warnings are useful for example to indicate when a route will need to be set in the near future, say when a train is approaching a junction at the end of a route controlled by automatic
signals. Warnings that are set for repeating services are given for each repeat. </p>

<p>Warnings are also provided automatically in circumstances where the
signaller may need to take some action, these include trains prevented from
entering or being created because existing trains are obstructing them; equipment and train failures and restoration; random delays imposed; routes locked; trains unable to split because the platform is too short or another train is in the way; and trains waiting for another train to join or to be joined by.</p>

<p>Remember to set separate warnings where there are different entries for
similar services, e.g. a shuttle feeder service is listed separately from the
shuttle service that it feeds, so both the feeder and the shuttle should have
warnings at similar locations if appropriate, but the repeat feature will take
care of all warnings for the shuttle services themselves.</p>

<p>If a warning is set for an arrival and departure event - <span
style='color:blue'>HH:MM;HH:MM;Location</span> - the warning is given on
arrival only, not departure. </p>

<p>Warnings are not permitted for 'Fjo' codes. If a warning is required when trains join
(as opposed to when they are waiting to join - at which time an automatic
warning is given) the 'W' should precede the 'jbo' event, not the 'Fjo' event.</p>

<p>See <a href="5.111w8h.htm">section 5.11</a> for some important aspects that
will help to avoid errors.</p>
