<p><a name=4></a><b>4 Setting preferred directions (PDs)</b></p>

<p>PDs are the directions that trains travel in during normal operation. Most
signals are set along PDs, and special arrangements are generally needed to
allow trains to travel in non-PDs. Track elements in this program's railways
may have PDs set either way, both ways, or not set. </p>

<p>The method used to set PDs is the same as that used to set lengths and speed
limits, but before they can be set the track must have been successfully linked
together - see <A HREF="3.14jht.htm">section 3.1 'Adding and deleting track and other railway elements'</A>.</p>

<p>Select menu items 'Mode' then 'Set preferred directions'. Note that if
another mode has been selected first then that must be exited by clicking the
red cross before the 'Mode' menu becomes available again. When in 'Set
preferred directions' mode left click the track element that represents the
start of the section to have a PD set, then left click another element in the
direction required towards the final element of the section to have a PD set
and on the desired route, and continue in this way until the final element is
reached. Sometimes, if there are two or more routes in different directions
from the start position to the next selected position, the program may choose
the wrong direction. In this case cancel, then select the start position again,
then select the element that is next to the start position in the desired
direction. This will set the direction correctly and further points can be
selected until the desired end point is reached. If there is only one route
between the start and end points then the second element may be the end point.
If the end point is a continuation or a buffer, the section is added straight
away and a message given to this effect. To truncate part of a selected length
just right click at the truncate point. To erase a selection truncate to the
start point, and to cancel a start selection without making a second selection
just click it again. Note that the selection can't end on leading points, because
the program doesn't know which of the two trailing legs to include.</p>

<p>Note that if the railway is complex a message may say that a path can't be
found to the selected element. This is usually because there are too may search
paths from the last selected element and the search is becoming too long. In
these circumstances select an element nearer to the last selected element. Note
also that if there is more than one route between the selected elements then
the program may choose the wrong one. In this case truncate back to the last
selection and choose an element where there is only a single route available.</p>

<p>At each position relevant buttons will be available consisting of <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_ADDPREFDIR.gif"> 'add section' to
add the selected length to the complete set of PDs, <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_CLEARONEPREFDIR.gif"> 'erase one' to erase the
selection (i.e. remove any PDs from the selected length), and <img width=24
height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_CLEARALLPREFDIR.gif"> 'erase all' to remove
all PDs from the railway. A warning message is given if this is selected.
Whenever the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_ADDPREFDIR.gif"> 'add
section' button is enabled it also has focus, meaning that instead of clicking
the button the 'enter' key may be pressed. This is often quicker when adding
several sections in succession.</p>

<p>In this mode a colour code is used to indicate PDs: original colour = no PD;
red = one PD - the arrows indicate which; and green = both directions set
(bidirectional running). Bidirectional running is often used in stations to
allow flexibility in routing trains.</p>

<p>The PD is indicated by an arrow on the relevant track on each element, which
is clear for all elements except points where just one arrow is shown on the
leading part of the points for one or both directions. This may be ambiguous in
some circumstances for the point in isolation, but preferred directions cannot
end on points, so reference to the directions of adjacent elements should make
the situation clear.</p>

<p>Note that if track is changed after PDs have been set, elements that have
been changed will have their PDs erased. In these circumstances it is
recommended to go back to the 'set preferred directions' mode to check and
reset the necessary directions.</p>

<p>In this mode bidirectional tracks may be set for complete areas, via the
'Edit' and 'Select' menu items. Select the area required as described under
'Selecting, cutting, copying and pasting etc.', then select 'Edit' and 'Set
bidirectional tracks'. This option is useful for quickly setting bidirectional
running in station areas to allow flexibility in routing trains.</p>
