<p><a name=6></a><b>6 Operating a railway:</b></p>

<p>When a railway has been saved as a '.rly' file and has one or more valid
timetables it is ready for operation. </p>

<p>Select menu items 'File', and 'Load railway', then click the 'Files of type'
drop-down box and click 'Railway file (.rly)'. Double click on the required
file to bring up the railway. Then select menu items 'File' and 'Load
timetable', and double click the required timetable. Finally select menu items
'Mode' and 'Operate railway'. </p>

<p>The railway is now in 'Pre-start' mode, which means that the clock is
stopped and trains won't run until the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_RUNGRAPHIC.gif"> 'Run' button is left clicked, but
routes may be set (see later) and train information is available. It is worth
setting up automatic signal routes in this mode, </p>

<p>which can be done manually or automatically (from v1.2.0) using the <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_PRESETAUTOSIGROUTES.gif"> ‘Preset
automatic signal routes’ button . This sets automatic signal routes on all
track sections without points, crossovers and level crossings that have single
preferred directions set and that lie between non-ground signals or between
continuations and non-ground signals. Automatic signal routes may be set on
tracks that are due to have trains created on them when the timetable begins,
and signals that lie behind these trains will be set appropriately as soon as
the trains are created. Beware though that any trains that are already in
motion may be affected by such signals, so try not to have more than one train
created on a given route at any one time. If trains are created on other types
of route then the route behind the train will be removed.</p>

<p>After the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_RUNGRAPHIC.gif"> 'run'
button is clicked and the railway is operating, this button changes into a <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_PAUSEGRAPHIC.gif"> 'pause' button .
When this is left clicked the clock stops and operation is suspended.
Information is available in this mode but no action may be taken that affects
the railway such as route setting or taking signaller control of trains. Note
that if operation is halted for any reason - by a screensaver, displaying
on-screen help, or by temporarily changing to another application - it will be
in 'pause' mode when it is restored. Also when the ‘run’ button is clicked the
‘Preset automatic signal routes’ button changes into a ‘Call-on’ button <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_CALLINGON.gif">.</p>

<p>During operation, although trains are normally running to a timetable, they
will run wherever the track leads. They stop at signals and buffers (if there
is time and braking capacity), and timetabled stop locations, but will only stop
for trains in front if they are being called-on, under signaller control (see
later), or at a timetabled stop location. Hence it is the signaller's
responsibility to keep trains safe and on the right tracks. Errors other than
crashes and derailments may usually be corrected by taking signaller control
and making appropriate corrections, at the cost of time and possible delays to
other trains. A train that runs on a wrongly set trailing point will become
derailed. Crashed and derailed trains must be removed from the railway by the
signaller.</p>
