<p><a name=6.9></a><b>6.9 Adjusting the timetable clock</b></p>

<p>During operation, but only when paused and not zoomed-out, clicking the <img
width=22 height=21 src="../images/RailSim2_TTCLOCK.gif"> 'adjust timetable
clock' button brings up the adjustment screen. This disables all other
functions and allows the clock speed to be slowed down or speeded up, from a
slowest speed of a quarter normal, to a fastest of sixteen times normal. When
the speed changes everything that is controlled by the timetable clock changes
accordingly - trains, route setting, locked route clearing, etc. The clock can
also be incremented by any amount by clicking the appropriate buttons as many
times as is required. When the clock is incremented only the clock is affected,
train positions stay the same. However if train movements were required during
the time that has been skipped then they will run late.</p>
