<p class=MsoNormal><b>6.13	Random delays</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Delays occur regularly on real railways and can also occur in RailOS if selected.  The most frequent are delays at stations and other locations from a wide variety of causes, followed by trackside delays caused by events such as signal and point failures, and temporary speed restrictions (TSRs) imposed for engineering work, trespassers, animals on the track and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four options are offered: none (the default setting), minor, moderate and major, selectable at any time during operation by a menu tab.  Delays at locations are at frequencies that vary inversely with duration, such that short delays are common and longer delays less common.  Point failures can occur any time they change state, either by route setting or manually, and signal failures can occur any time they change aspect.  Temporary speed restrictions occur randomly at any time.  In all cases the delay, failure and TSR frequencies increase with increasing selection from minor to major.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Failures and TSRs are indicated by a black (white background) or white (dark background) rounded square around the element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a point failure occurs during route setting the route won't be set.  If an already failed point is encountered when route setting and the route is in the 'set' direction then the route passes through the point.  If it's in the 'non-set' direction then the search routine will try to find an alternative route, otherwise the route will fail.  Trains can run on failed points in the direction that's set but with a speed restriction of 10km/h.  Failed points can't be changed manually.  When a point has failed an estimate of the repair time is shown in the track information window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Signals can fail when they change aspect when route setting or when a train passes them under timetable control.  If a signal failure occurs during route setting the route won't be set.  Existing failed signals don't affect route setting, but trains must stop as for a red signal.  Failed signals can only be passed under signaller control, when it is recommended to select 'Step forward one element', after which timetable control can be restored.  Signal repair time estimates are shown as for points.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TSRs occur at random times.  They don't affect route setting but impose a speed limit of 10km/h.  TSR removal time estimates are shown as for failure repair times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a failure or TSR occurs a message is given and the performance file, on-screen log and warning panel record the event.  Similarly when a failure is repaired or a TSR lifted a message is given and the performance file, on-screen log and warning panel are updated accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The delay selection remains in place until it is changed by the user or RailOS closes.  It is not saved with sessions, so a reloaded session will be subject to the selection already in place.</p>
