<P><B><A NAME="1"></A>1.1  Notes for Windows 10 and 11 users</B></P>
 
<P>When running under Windows 10 there is a display anomaly in that if the taskbar is hidden when the screen is maximised the display flashes, especially when routes are being set. Therefore to avoid this please either have the taskbar showing or don't maximise the screen.</P>

<P>Windows 11 has an even more prominent display flashing problem but it can be avoided in the same way - either have the taskbar showing or don't maximise the screen.</P>

<P>Windows 11 reduces the size of the 'Actions Due' panel so that the text is cropped. It also crops the bottom of the performance panel (the functions of these panels are explained later). Because of this from v2.20.3 these panels are now resizeable and can be enlarged by grabbing a corner with the mouse and expanding them. Please note that the 'Actions Due' panel should be tall enough to allow 20 entries so as to prevent a vertical scrollbar appearing which obscures some of the text.</P>

<P>Windows 11 enlarges the text on pre-Windows 11 railway layouts. Therefore when operating these railways some of the text might need to be reduced in size or repositioned in order to avoid obscuring other railway features.</P>

<P>The reasons why these anomalies occur isn't known but internet searches show that others often complain about them. Microsoft normally advises users to update their display drivers but the problems still occur with up to date drivers.</P>

<P>
