<p><a name=3.1.1></a><b>3.1.1 Track element types</b></p>

<p><b>Straights, curves, buffers, bridges, points and crossovers</b></p>

<p>Hopefully these are all fairly self-evident. However points and crossovers
can't be placed next to buffers as there must be room for a train (2 elements
long) without fouling any of these elements. Note also that some straight
elements have directional arrows. These are purely for visual clarity, they
don't need to relate to preferred directions (though clearly they should to
avoid confusion). Preferred directions are set separately and described in 
<a href="4001g.htm">section 4.</a> </p>

<p><b>Signals</b></p>

<p>Signals can be two, three or four-aspect, or ground position lights. The
signal type button <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_FOURASPECT.gif"> represents four-aspect, and clicking
the button changes it to three-aspect <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_THREEASPECT.gif">, then two-aspect <img width=24
height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_TWOASPECT.gif">, then ground position light <img
width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_GROUNDSIG.gif">, then back to
four-aspect. Signals of the appropriate type are placed on the railway whenever
the corresponding signal button is selected. Note that two, three and
four-aspect signals all appear the same when placed, but the type is indicated
in the floating window when track information is selected.</p>

<p>Signals can be positioned on the left or the right of the track relative to the direction of travel (<A HREF="2.14gc1.htm">see section 2.1</A>).  Trains recognise and act on signals in the direction of travel only.  Signals are not normally permitted immediately before or after a bridge because it wouldn't be possible to truncate the route to that signal (see <A HREF="6.14sz5.htm">section 6.1 'Route setting and cancelling'</A>). This is because a bridge is potentially ambiguous as it may have two routes set on it.  However this restriction can be overridden if required - an on-screen message provides information.</p>

<p>Note that signals can't be placed next to buffers as there must be room for
a train (2 elements long) in the siding without straddling a signal. Also two
same-direction signals can't be placed next to each other as there must be room
for a train between them.</p>

<p><b>Level Crossings</b></p>

<p>All crossings are closed to trains
initially (i.e. barriers raised), and are opened on one of two ways.<br>
<br>
The first and usual way is by creating a preferred
direction or unrestricted route through it, automatic signal routes aren't permitted. The barriers begin to lower as soon as the route is in place, the
lowering indicated by the 'barriers down' graphic flashing. While it is
flashing other routes can be created elsewhere in the railway but no other
route can be created across the crossing until the barriers are fully
down. They stay down while there is a route in place, and start to rise as soon
as all routes have been cleared - in this case the 'barriers up' graphic flashes.
The barriers take 30 seconds to lower and 10 seconds to rise. The first signal
behind and facing the barriers stays red until the barriers are fully down.<br>
<br>

The second way is to left click it (provided that there is no route through it and no train on it).  This opens the crossing manually.  In this case the barriers begin to lower as before, but now the colour is green rather than red to indicate manual operation.  Signals behave as before.  Trains can cross with or without routes, and the crossing will remain open until closed manually, again by left clicking when there is no route across it.  A manually openend crossing will not close automatically after a train has passed because there may be other trains that need to use it.  Opening and closing times are as before.  A level crossing that is opened by a route cannot be closed manually.  The green colour is a reminder that the crossing is to be closed manually when no longer required, to avoid the heavy time penalty that would be incurred if forgotten. To help in this respect if any manual crossing is open to trains without a route across it a warning icon <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/ManualLCDownImage.bmp"> is shown flashing on the left hand side of the screen.  Also all such level crossings are shown flashing in zoom out mode.<br>
<br>

Level crossings display differently for barriers up and down, with barriers shown
across the road for down and across the railway for up. Although modern barrier
crossings don't really lie across the railway I think it makes it clearer that
the way is blocked for trains if barriers are shown in this way. Crossings can
be placed across any number of directly parallel tracks, but can only be placed
on plain horizontal or vertical track elements. Note that level crossings
cannot be placed adjacent to each other on the same track.<br>
<br>

Up to three minutes is allowed for the barriers to remain down before penalty times
start clocking up, so it doesn't pay to set routes or open a crossing manually too far in advance of trains. If a barrier is lowered and then raised (by cancelling the route or manually) before any trains have passed, then the three minutes allowance isn't given,
penalty times begin clocking up right away. Penalties are shown in the performance log summary (<A HREF="6.74szb.htm">see section 6.7</A>) as 'excess minutes of level crossing barrier down time'.  If several logs are created successively it might be noticed that this figure is lower in later logs than earlier ones.  This is because a log created when crossing barriers are down but before a train has passed doesn't deduct the three minutes allowance, whereas a later log created after the train has passed will include it. <br>
<br>

Level crossings are treated as
being closed to trains in all states other than with barriers fully down, so
if a train runs into one when the barriers are not fully down then there is a crash
(it's assumed to have hit a road vehicle) and the train has to be removed by
the signaller. </p>

<p><b>Parapets</b></p>

<p>These are visual elements only, to improve the appearance of the railway by
indicating bridge and tunnel parapets, they don't play any part in operation.</p>

<p><b>Continuations</b></p>

<p>Elements that represent the limit of the railway, where track extends
outside RailOS's control area are referred to as 'Continuations' <img width=16
height=16 src="../images/RailSim2_GL81.gif">. The dotted section represents the
outside edge. Trains enter and leave the railway at these elements.</p>

<p>Continuations used for train entry should be protected by entry signals, ideally placed so that a stopped train has its rear element on the continuation so the whole train is visible.  This is because following trains will not enter when the entry is blocked by a train, but if the earlier train is held further along then the later train will crash into it.</p>

<p><b>Gaps</b></p>

<p>Gaps <img width=16 height=16 src="../images/RailSim2_GL89SET.gif"> represent
elements that connect to other elements that are not immediately adjacent.
There must always be an even number of gaps which are arranged in paired
connections. When part of a train moves off one gap it appears immediately on
the connected gap. Gaps allow continuous sections of railway to be separated
visually, for example to display a long section of track on a single screen.
They are also useful for long bridges or tunnels, to avoid having several
single-element bridges adjacent to each other. Right clicking the mouse on a
gap that has been set shows the two connected gaps - flashing red for the
clicked gap, and flashing green for the connected gap. This is useful during operation as a reminder of which gap connects to which. If the gaps are widely separated the screen viewpoint can be moved to find the connected gap - this is particularly useful in zoom-out mode. Left clicking the mouse on the screen in zoom-in mode stops
the gaps flashing.</p>

<p>When first placed, the oval area of the gap is hollow, to indicate that it
isn't yet connected to another gap. When unconnected gaps are present in a
railway under construction the <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_GAPSNOTSETGRAPHIC.gif"> icon is displayed at the left
side of the screen, and the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_CONNECTGAPS.gif"> 'connect gaps' button is enabled,
which is used to connect gaps to each other in turn. During connection RailOS highlights a gap with flashing red and white circles, at which point the corresponding gap should be left-clicked, this is then highlighted briefly with a green circle before the next gap to be connected is highlighted. The screen may be zoomed-out and navigated freely during gap setting, because connected gaps may not always lie on the same screen (though it's clearer if
they are). When all gaps have been connected the <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_GAPSSETGRAPHIC.gif"> icon is displayed and the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_VALIDATE.gif"> 'link track' button becomes available. To disconnect gaps delete one of the gaps and replace it.</p>
