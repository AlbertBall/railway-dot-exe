<P><B><A NAME="2.3"></A>2.3  Folders and Files</B></P>

<P>When RailOS is opened for the first time a number of folders ('folder' is a modern term for 'directory') are created in the working folder (also known as the current directory), which is normally where the program itself - 'RailOS32/64.exe' - resides.  To make sure that RailOS32/64.exe is in the working folder set up a desktop shortcut to it and check in the shortcut properties that the 'Start in:' entry matches 'Target:', but without '\RailOS32/64.exe'.</P>

<P>The folders created by RailOS are:</P>

<P>Formatted timetables - for user-readable timetables, see sections 5.10 and 5.12;<br>
Images - for storing railway images, see section 3;<br>
Graphics - for storing user-defined graphics, see sections 3.1 and 3.2;<br> 
Performance logs - for storing logs of operating sessions, see section 6.7;<br>
Program timetables - for program-readable timetables, see section 5;<br>
Railways - for storing railways that are operational or being developed, see sections 3 and 4; and<br>
Sessions - for storing operating sessions, see section 6.3.</P>

<P>The folders for storing railways, timetables and sessions can be changed by the user if required, and these changes will be saved when RailOS closes and reloaded next time it opens.</P>

<P>There are two types of railway file.  Development files, used during building and modifying a railway, have the extension '.dev'.  Railways that are ready for operation have the extension '.rly'.</P>

<P>Timetable files (extension '.ttb') may be saved during development and when finished, and during operation the current state of the railway (a 'session' - extension '.ssn') may be saved at any time and reloaded at a later time.  </P>

<P>During operation a performance log of all activities is compiled.  This may be viewed on-screen or hidden, and is saved after operation along with a performance summary in a permanent text file (extension '.txt').</P>

<P>Railway image files (extension '.bmp' - bitmap files) may be saved at any time, consisting of track and text, with or without an element grid (useful for planning purposes during construction); with preferred directions; and during operation.  Image files always display with black track on a white background, regardless of the track colour and background in use.</P>

<P>Users may add their own graphic files with extension .bmp, .jpg, .gif or .png, and these are saved in the 'Graphics' folder.  Information on their use is provided in <a href="html\3.14jht.htm">section 3.1.</a></P>

<P>It is suggested that unwanted performance logs, sessions and images be deleted periodically as they can take up a considerable amount of space.  This particularly applies to image files.  If particular images are to be saved then it is best to convert them to '.jpg' files rather '.bmp' files, using a suitable image processing program, since '.jpg' files use much less memory.  If particular sessions, performance logs or images are to be saved, then it is probably best to rename them to something more meaningful so that they are easy to distinguish from other similar files - but be sure to retain the same extension (i.e. '.ssn', '.bmp', 'jpg' etc.).</P>

<P>All files apart from images - i.e. railways, timetables, performance logs and sessions, as well as an error log if a fatal error is encountered during program use, are all text files, and are readable using a word processor or text editor, though it is strongly recommended that any file that is used by RailOS shouldn't be altered outside the program or it may not work correctly afterwards.   A number of other files are used, temporary files with extension .tmp that store timetables when multiple railways are in use at the same time (these can be deleted after all railways are closed), a configuration file 'Config.txt' that stores the current background colour, the trackside signal location - left hand or right hand, the folder locations for railways, timetables and sessions that are in use when RailOS closes, and default values for track element length and speed limit.</P>

<P>Help.chm is RailOS's on-screen help file, opened by selecting 'Help' then 'Railway help'.</P>

<P>A number of other .bpl and .dll files are stored in the same folder as RailOS32/64.exe and are needed for the program to operate.  In effect these files are extensions of the program itself. </P>
