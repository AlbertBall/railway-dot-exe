<p>A train may split from the front, where the new split-off service appears in
front of the original service, or from the rear. The line that contains these codes also
contains the service reference for the split-off service. The split-off service
has code 'Sfs' (start from split) and also the service reference for the
service that it splits from. </p>

<p>One thing to beware of during operation is that the platform at which the
split occurs must be long enough to allow it. The condition is that both trains
must be at a platform after the split, although only one element of the train
(half its length) need be at a platform. Additionally at least one of the final
four elements that the two trains stand on must overlap one of the original
train elements, and RailOS will maximise the number of train elements at
platforms. This means that the original train may be repositioned during the
split. Therefore the minimum platform length is two elements, providing there
is a track element linked at each end. If one end is a buffer then the platform
must be at least three elements long. When the timetable is first validated
(either during editing or on loading for operation) a check is made that each
location at which a split occurs has at least one platform that is long enough,
but it is up to the signaller to ensure that the actual platform that the train
arrives at is long enough for the split. If it isn't then a warning message is
given and the train will need to be moved under signaller control to find an
appropriate platform. To be safe it is best to ensure that platforms where splits are to occur are several elements long. A second thing to beware of is to try to ensure that
after a split both trains lie behind a protecting signal. If one of the trains
straddles a signal, then that signal does not provide any protection, and when
the train's departure time is reached it will depart without a route having
been set. Note that because the number of train elements that will be standing
at platforms is maximised, it may be necessary to move an obstructing train
further away than would appear to be strictly necessary, but when it has been
moved sufficiently the split will occur.</p>

<p>When trains split the mass, power and braking force are split evenly between
them (so the performance remains the same), and the maximum running speed is
the same for the new service as the original.</p>

<p>For services that split it is best to avoid descriptions that include the
number of cars. The original service description doesn't change during
operation so such descriptions will become incorrect after a split.</p>

<p>See <a href="5.111w8h.htm">section 5.11</a> for some important aspects that
will help to avoid errors.</p>
