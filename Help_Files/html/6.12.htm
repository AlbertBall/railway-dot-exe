<p class=MsoNormal><b>6.12     Skipping timetabled events</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When trains suffer delays it is often useful to be able to
skip stops and other timetabled events in order to make up time and
re-establish a normal schedule, especially when other services depend on
connections.  This is normal practice on real railways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This can be done in the simulation for events within a
service.  When operating (not paused) and a train is stopped at a signal or a
location and is under timetable control, right click it to show the popup menu
and select 'Skip timetabled event(s)'.  This gives a list of events from that
point onwards, similar to timetable information in the floating window. 
Lefi-clicking an event selects that event as the next, i.e. the selected event
itself isn't skipped.  There have to be restrictions on events that can be
selected related to where the train is at the time and where the selected event
takes place.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1.  Trains stopped at a signal:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>Only arrivals, passes or exit
railway events can be selected since all others take place at locations and the
train hasn't yet arrived at those locations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.  Trains stopped at a location:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>a) any event up to and including
the departure from that location can be selected, when all events before the
selection are skipped;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:36.0pt'>b) any event after the departure that
is an arrival, pass or exit railway can be selected, when all events after the
departure but before the selection are skipped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It isn't possible to skip the finish event, so trains that
change to a different service at a location can't have the change of service
brought forward to an earlier location, as is sometimes done in real practice. 
This is because of the way that the timetable is structured - events can be
skipped but can't be changed during operation.</p>
