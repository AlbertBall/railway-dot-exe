<p><a name=3.3></a><b>3.3 Named locations</b></p>

<p>Two types of named location are provided: stations, and non-station named
locations. Station elements consist of platforms, concourses, footbridges and underpasses. These are indicated by reddish-brown coloured elements, the narrow ones representing platforms that may be placed alongside horizontal or vertical track elements, or along the straight track of points; the full square representing a concourse, positioned where there is no track and used to link platforms together; and footbridges/underpasses that lie at 90 degrees to the track and link platforms; and concourses across vertical or horizontal track. Footbridges/underpasses allow station
elements to be linked together that would otherwise be too far apart. All
station elements that are linked together take the same name. Trains stop at
platforms if the timetable includes the station as a stop, and the stop
position is central for through platforms (with one extra free element behind
than in front for platforms with an odd number of elements), and is at the buffers
for terminal platforms. This arrangement allows for other trains to stop both
in front of and behind earlier trains when there is room at the platform to do
so.</p>

<p>Non-station named locations are shown as blue squares, and are used to name
sidings, depots, works, buffers, tunnels, bridges, continuations, junction
approaches and anything else that needs a name.  They are positioned either on blank elements or on top of track elements other than bridges, gaps and level crossings. All non-station named elements that are linked take the same name, but they do not link to stations so they may be positioned adjacent to station elements but have their own name. Trains will stop at all non-station named locations (providing the name is in the timetable) except
continuations - continuation names are for identification and logging purposes
only - and it is recommended that these be named for these purposes. The stop
position is fixed relative to the length of the named location and direction of
train travel, but in all cases the train stops with its front adjacent to the
end of the location, to allow as much room as possible behind for other
trains.</p>

<p>Named elements link together vertically and horizontally, but not
diagonally. This is straightforward for non-station named locations because
they consist of full-sized (16 x 16 pixel) elements only. It can be more
confusing for stations, because platforms only occupy part of an element. The
point to remember is that an element with a platform on it is a station
element, so it will link to any other station element in the vertical or horizontal
directions. Hence the following two arrangements are horizontally linked <img
width=48 height=33 src="../images/NEL1.gif"> and <img width=47 height=37
src="../images/NEL2.gif">, but the next arrangement is not linked because the
station elements are diagonal to each other <img width=48 height=36
src="../images/NEL3.gif">.</p>

<p>Note that named locations may be located where there are signals. This is useful when space is tight but is not generally recommended because problems may occur when trains are required to split - see <A HREF="5.2.1e43.htm">section 5.2.3 'Splits'</A>. Locations with very long platforms that are designed to hold two or more trains can use embedded signals, but signaller control may be required to move trains up a platform to their departure position.</p>

<p>Names are allocated using the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_NAMELOCS.gif"> 'name location' button. Any named
element may be selected for this purpose except footbridges and underpasses. Names are
case-sensitive and must be unique (King's Cross and KING'S CROSS are different
locations as far as RailOS is concerned). A warning is given if a second
location is given the same name as an earlier one. If it is so named, the
earlier name is erased. When a name has been given it appears as text on the
display in the font that is currently set. Generally the position of the name
will need to be adjusted using the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_MOVETEXT.gif"> 'move text or graphics' button as described earlier.
Fonts may be changed using the <img width=24 height=24
src="../images/RailSim2_FONTGRAPHIC.gif"> 'change text font' button, and this
font will apply for all future names. If it is wished to change the font of
existing names then first change the default font, select one of the named
elements using the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_NAMELOCS.gif"> button,
then just press 'enter' and the name will change to the new font. This may be
done repeatedly to change several location name fonts in turn if required. Note
that this is a different procedure to changing the font of existing text that
doesn't represent a location name. This is explained under 'Adding, deleting
and moving text'.</p>

<p>When a location is named and the text positioned on screen, the positioning system works as follows: if there is space, the top of the text is placed slightly higher than the highest named element.  If there isn't space above the highest named element then it is placed slightly lower than the lowest.  If the named location covers the entire height of the screen or more, so that there is no higher or lower space for the name, then it is placed in the centre of the screen, at the horizontal position of leftmost named element.  This has been explained to avoid confusion when it is found that location names occupy different positions on screen in different circumstances, and to provide an indication of where to expect the name to be positioned in each case.</p>

<p>To erase the name of a named location select one of the named elements as
above, then erase the contents of the box and press 'enter'.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT:  Do not change the names of named locations by using the 'change text' method described in section 3.2 (unless it is intended that the displayed name be different to the timetabled name), otherwise the displayed name will change but the location name within the program (the name used by the timetable) will not change and the result may cause confusion.  Trains always comply with the timetable regarding the location name, regardless of what text is on screen.  If the screen text is lost or altered inadvertently for a location name, the internal location name may be checked by selecting 'Information', 'Track information' and 'Show', and may be recovered on screen by left clicking the </b><img width=24
height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_NAMELOCS.gif"><b> button and selecting the location.  Its name will then appear in the box and may be re-entered by pressing 'enter', at which time it will reappear on the screen - as well as the earlier changed name, which may be removed or moved elsewhere if required.</b></p>

<p>RailOS will allow text to be added to the railway that is the same as
named locations, but this should be avoided if possible. If this is done and a
location name is erased or changed, then the wrong text may be affected,
because RailOS doesn't know which of the two (or more) identical pieces of
text should be allocated to the named location.</p>

<p>When a location name element is first placed, it is shown striped, to
indicate that it isn't yet named. When named it changes to full colour. In
zoom-out mode unnamed locations appear pink for stations, and green for
non-station locations. These help identify locations that still await naming. A
railway that contains unnamed locations has the <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_LOCNAMESNOTSETGRAPHIC.gif"> icon on the left. When all
are named this changes to <img width=20 height=20
src="../images/RailSim2_LOCNAMESSETGRAPHIC.gif">.</p>

<p>When building a railway try to avoid naming a location until all associated named elements have been placed.
Although additional named elements may be added to an existing named location,
and they will take the same name, the process can be time-consuming, especially
with a large location and a slow computer.</p>

<p>If a named location has any of its elements deleted it will revert to being unnamed and its name will disappear from the screen.</p>
