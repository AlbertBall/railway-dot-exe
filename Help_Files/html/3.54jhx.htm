<p><a name=3.5></a><b>3.5 Selecting, cutting, copying and pasting etc.</b></p>

<p>During build, in 'Build/modify' mode, complete areas of the display may be
manipulated using the 'Edit' and 'Select' menus, and selected areas can be filled with particular track elements or deleted. After clicking 'Select' the area is formed by clicking on the screen then dragging the left mouse button.  A dotted rectangle is shown which grows as the mouse is dragged, and is fully defined when the button is released. If a different area is required then the process can be restarted by left clicking the mouse button as before. When defined, the 'Edit' menu presents a range of options for cutting, copying, deleting, rotating etc. When cutting or copying are selected, left click the mouse anywhere inside the area, then drag it to the new position. It will stay where it is when the
button is released, but it may be picked up and moved again if desired. If it
is to be moved to another screen then drag it to or beyond the edge, move the
viewpoint in the required direction, then pick it up and move it again. When
its position is as required go back to the 'Edit' menu and paste the area.
Pasting overwrites any track or text that lies in the pasted area. After a cut pasting retains all track lengths, speed limits, location names and preferred directions. These same values are also retained when a selection is flipped, mirrored or rotated. After a copy pasting retains everything except location names. The reason is that two locations can't have the same name. Note that any additional elements needed to link repositioned areas to the existing railway will require speeds and lengths setting where the defaults are unsuitable, and any gaps within the selected area will be unset and require resetting. For any action except copy preferred directions need to be reset for elements that link to repositioned elements, and if there are train entry and exit points in the repositioned area the element identifiers will need to be changed in the timetable (see later).</p>

<p>To fill an area with a particular track element click the 'Add or remove track elements' button <u>before</u> clicking the 'Edit' and 'Select' menu items.  Make the selection as before then click the required track element button - any except a level crossing.  What happens is exactly the same as if the element is selected and the screen left clicked at every position within the area, so blank spaces are filled with the element but existing elements within the area are not overwritten.  Similarly if a platform element is selected it will be placed next to existing valid track elements but if there is no track then nothing happens.  Although any element can be selected apart from level crossings the most useful ones are horizontal and vertical track elements, where areas can be filled quickly without having to click each position individually.</p>

<p>After a selection has been made there is an option to 'Reselect'. This
reselects the repositioned area and is useful for example for repeated copying of
the same selection.</p>

<p>When text is enclosed within a selection then it will be moved, copied or rotated etc. along with the track.  Be aware though that to move or copy text the top left hand corner of the first character of the text must be enclosed within the selection (and this point will be slightly above the first visible character).  Hence even though the text may appear to move with the selection it may be found that on pasting it has been left behind.  If this happens then it may easily be repositioned using the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_MOVETEXT.gif"> 'move text or graphics' button. Track and graphics must be wholly enclosed within the selection to be moved or copied etc.</p>

<p>When an area is selected prior to rotating by 90 degrees right or left the area is first checked to see whether or not it is square, and if not then it is changed to a square.  The option is then given to keep this square or to select again.  Only square selections are permitted because otherwise on rotation existing areas of the railway may be erased inadvertently as the horizontal and vertical dimensions are interchanged.  This danger doesn't arise with square selections as both dimensions are the same.  The square that the program selects is obtained by retaining the left hand vertical side of the user-selected area and making the horizontal dimension the same by extending or reducing it to the right of the left hand edge.  If that process makes the square extend beyond the right hand edge of the screen then the right hand edge is retained instead and the square extended or reduced to the left of the right hand edge.  Also for 90 degree rotations any text, including named locations, that is enclosed is not rotated because text always stays horizontal and attempting to rotate it by 90 degrees would give a very poor result with much of the text obscured by track elements.  Instead it is retained as a vertical list along the left hand edge of the selected area.  It can then be positioned appropriately by using the <img width=24 height=24 src="../images/RailSim2_MOVETEXT.gif"> 'move text or graphics' button.  Graphics are repositioned when rotating, mirroring or flipping, but are not themselves re-orientated.  If it is required to have re-orientated graphics then the manipulation should be done in an image editor and the changed file saved in the 'Graphics' folder with a new name.</p>

<p>Note that if the selected area contains a lot of elements then there will be a delay before the next action can be selected. Please avoid clicking the mouse buttons or dragging the area during this time because although nothing appears to happen the actions take place after the delay and may not be what is expected. The information panel gives advice as appropriate.</p>

<p>An option is also provided to set track element lengths and/or line speeds. This is in addition to the ability to set these parameters along the track, which is described later. The option to set an area as a whole is useful for example  at stations, where blanket speed limits often apply and track element lengths may be made much shorter so that more track detail may be included without extending distances. Note that when using this option each track element  length is set individually to the values chosen. When setting lengths along the track (describbed below), the complete length is chosen and is divided up between the number of elements that are included. Before this option can be  used the track must have been successfully linked together - see <A HREF="3.14jht.htm">section 3.1 'Adding and deleting track and other railway elements'</A>. Information about track lengths and line speeds is available from the 'Information' menu by selecting 'Track information'. Then, when the mouse hovers over a track element these values may be seen, along with the track identifier (ID), which is used in timetabling.</p>
