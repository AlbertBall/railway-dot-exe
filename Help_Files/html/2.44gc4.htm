<P>An 'information' panel is normally displayed during use, indicated by a blue 'I' symbol.  This shows in brief what options are available at a particular stage.  Additionally, hovering the mouse over any button gives information about its function.</P>

<P>The name of the railway that is currently loaded is displayed in the title bar at the top of the screen, together with the name of the timetable if loaded.  If no railway is loaded or a railway is under development but has not yet been saved the title bar displays 'New railway under development'.</P>

<P>The 'Information' tab offers four options: track information, train status information, train timetable information, and display of long service references.  All these act as toggles, allowing the relevant information to be shown or hidden.  By default track information and long service reference display are off, but train status and timetable information are on.  When the first three are on, the information is displayed in a floating window when the mouse hovers over a track element or a train.  Service references are described later but in brief they represent train identifiers.  Train headcodes in the UK consist of four characters, and during operation a train appears on screen with these four characters.  However additional characters are often required in order to allow for longer headcodes in other countries, and to identify uniquely in the timetable trains with the same headcode.  Up to eight characters are permitted in all, with the last four in all cases shown on the train itself.  The last option 'display of long service references' shows the full (up to eight characters) train identifier on screen above the train.  These only show when there are more than four characters because the train itself is indicated by these four characters.</P>
